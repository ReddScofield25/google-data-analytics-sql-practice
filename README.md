# Google Data Analytics — SQL Practice Repository  
This repository documents my SQL learning journey through the **Google Data Analytics Certificate** program (via *ITExperience Inc.*).  
It contains the SQL files, custom tables, query templates, and notes generated from hands-on activities across different courses and modules.

The goal of this repo is to **track my progress**, **organize practical SQL work**, and **build a transparent portfolio** that demonstrates my ability to query real datasets using tools like **Google BigQuery**.

---

## 📚 What This Repository Contains  
Each SQL-related activity from the Google Data Analytics program is stored in its own folder with:

- **Raw SQL files**  
- **Dataset references** (public datasets or custom tables)  
- **Challenge queries**  
- **Reflection answers**  
- **A detailed `notes.md` file** explaining the purpose, process, and results of the activity

This helps viewers explore my work **without needing access to my BigQuery console**.

As I progress through the program, more folders and activities will be added following this structure.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **SQL**  
- **Google BigQuery**  
- **BigQuery Public Datasets**  
- **Custom BigQuery Tables**  
- **Cloud-based Data Warehousing Concepts**  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives Covered  
This repository reflects hands-on practice with skills including:

- Querying large public datasets  
- Creating custom tables in BigQuery  
- Importing files and defining schemas  
- Writing queries with:
  - `SELECT`
  - `FROM`
  - `WHERE`
  - `ORDER BY`
  - `LIMIT`
- Understanding relational structure and dataset references  
- Preparing data for exploration at scale  

Each notes.md file explains what was learned in that specific activity.

---

## 🔗 How to Use This Repository  
You can explore any activity by opening its folder and reading:

- The SQL files — to see the exact queries  
- The notes.md — to understand the context, purpose, and findings  

If you want to run the queries:

1. Open **Google BigQuery** (free tier works).  
2. Use the dataset path found in the activity’s notes.  
3. Copy/paste the SQL into the BigQuery editor.  

Public dataset paths like:  
```
bigquery-public-data.london_bicycles.cycle_hire
```
are fully accessible to anyone.

For custom tables, replace the project ID with your own.
